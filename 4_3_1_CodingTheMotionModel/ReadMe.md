Now that we have manually calculated each step for determining the motion model probability, we will implement these steps in a function. The starter code in the editor steps through each position x, calls the motion_model function and prints the results to stdout. To complete this exercise fill in the motion_model function which will involve:  
* For each 洧논<sub>洧노</sub>:
  * Calculate the transition probability for each potential value 洧논<sub>洧노-1</sub>
  * Calculate the discrete motion model probability by multiplying the transition model probability by the belief state (prior) for 洧논<sub>洧노-1</sub>

* Return total probability (sum) of each discrete probability

Once you implement your solution in the editor on the right, you can compile and run your code with the button below, and see the results in the terminal.
